        "## Project Motivation\n",
        "\n",
        "Autism has historically been under-recognised in females, with research indicating that diagnostic criteria and clinical understanding have been shaped largely around male presentations. This has contributed to delayed, missed, or incorrect diagnoses among females, with significant implications for mental health, education, and access to appropriate support services.\n",
        "\n",
        "In recent years, NHS England has published open datasets on autism referrals and assessment pathways, providing an opportunity to explore how referral patterns for females are evolving over time. Understanding these trends is important not only for evaluating awareness and access to services, but also for informing healthcare planning and identifying potential systemic barriers within diagnostic pathways.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project is motivated by the need to examine whether female autism referrals in England demonstrate distinct temporal and age-based patterns, and to consider what these trends may suggest about visibility, service demand, and diagnostic access for autistic females.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "The objectives of this project are to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Design and implement an end-to-end ETL pipeline to extract, clean, and structure NHS England autism referral data for analysis.\n",
        "- Explore temporal trends in female autism referrals to identify changes in suspected autism referrals and open cases over time.\n",
        "- Analyse age-group patterns within female referrals to examine how referral volumes differ across developmental stages.\n",
        "- Develop clear static and interactive visualisations to communicate trends and patterns in an accessible and stakeholder-oriented manner.\n",
        "- FCritically evaluate the limitations and ethical considerations associated with using aggregated public healthcare data to study autism referral pathways.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Hypotheses\n",
        "\n",
        "- H1: Female suspected autism referrals show an overall increasing trend over time, indicating rising demand and/or improved recognition.\n",
        "- H2: The number of females with open suspected autism referrals remains consistently higher than new referrals, suggesting backlog pressure within diagnostic pathways.\n",
        "- H3: Age-group patterns differ within females, with 0–17 and 18+ showing distinct referral volumes, supporting the need for age-targeted service planning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Inputs\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "All datasets used in this analysis are publicly available, aggregated, and anonymised. No personal or identifiable information is included.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sources:\n",
        "- NHS Digital: Autism diagnosis statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "Ethical considerations include responsible interpretation of diagnosis data and avoidance of deficit-based language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Outputs\n",
        "\n",
        "Outputs produced by this project include:\n",
        "\n",
        "• A cleaned and transformed analytical dataset derived from NHS England autism statistics.\n",
        "• A series of static visualisations illustrating female autism referral trends, distributions, and comparisons across age groups and reporting periods.\n",
        "• An interactive Plotly dashboard (female_autism_dashboard.html) visualising female autism referral trends over time in England.\n",
        "• A fully documented Jupyter Notebook containing the ETL pipeline, exploratory analysis, visualisations, and methodological commentary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Preparation and Management\n",
        "\n",
        "### File Organisation and Data Management Rationale\n",
        "\n",
        "This project separates files into dedicated folders to support good data governance and reproducibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `data/raw/` stores the original NHS dataset unchanged, preserving a clear source of truth.\n",
        "- `data/processed/` contains cleaned and transformed versions of the data used for analysis.\n",
        "- `reports/` stores generated analytical outputs, including the interactive Plotly dashboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "This structure prevents accidental overwriting of source data, improves traceability of analytical steps, and aligns with best practices in professional data analytics workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Use of Generative AI (GenAI) in this Project\n",
        "\n",
        "GenAI (CoPilot) was used to support the workflow:\n",
        "1. **Code support and debugging:** assisting with troubleshooting environment issues (VS Code/Jupyter/Plotly rendering) and improving the reliability of file outputs (e.g., ensuring folders exist before writing HTML).\n",
        "2. **Data storytelling and communication:** refining the project title, motivation, objectives, and writing clear interpretations of each chart for a non-technical audience.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Additional Comments\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates how publicly available healthcare data can be used to explore gender-based disparities in autism referral patterns. A key challenge was working with aggregated administrative data, which required careful interpretation to avoid misleading conclusions. The project also highlighted the importance of transparent data cleaning, reproducible workflows, and ethical framing when analysing sensitive health-related topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "From a technical perspective, the project strengthened skills in building an end-to-end data analysis pipeline, including structured data transformation, exploratory analysis, and the development of both static and interactive visual outputs suitable for non-technical stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this work illustrates how data analytics can support healthcare service planning by identifying patterns in referral demand and highlighting areas where further targeted research is needed.\n",
        "\n"

        "This project analysed NHS England autism referral data to explore patterns in female autism diagnosis and service demand over time. Using a full ETL pipeline, the dataset was cleaned, transformed, and structured for descriptive, trend-based, and visual analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The findings indicate that while newly suspected autism referrals among females remain substantially lower than the number of patients on open referral pathways, both measures show similar trends across time. This suggests sustained pressure on diagnostic services and highlights the likelihood of long waiting lists and potential under-diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interactive dashboard further demonstrates how temporal analysis can support healthcare planning by enabling stakeholders to explore referral dynamics and service load more effectively. Overall, this project illustrates how data analytics can be applied to public health datasets to surface meaningful insights around gender disparities, service accessibility, and long-term demand."

        "This analysis is limited by the structure of the specific NHS England dataset used. The data is aggregated and, in this extract, does not include individual-level demographic variables such as ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or confirmed diagnostic outcomes. As a result, the scope for deeper intersectional analysis of how autism referral pathways may differ across multiple social and identity factors is restricted.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the dataset reflects suspected autism referrals and open cases rather than confirmed diagnoses. Consequently, the trends observed may be influenced by service capacity, administrative processes, and policy or reporting changes, rather than accurately representing underlying prevalence alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ethically, this project uses fully anonymised, open-access public sector data. No personally identifiable information is included. Care has been taken to avoid stigmatising interpretations, and the findings are framed from a systems-level perspective, recognising that autism identification rates are shaped by healthcare access, diagnostic practices, and social awareness rather than individual characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future research could integrate additional NHS datasets that include ethnicity and indices of multiple deprivation, alongside outcome-level diagnostic data. This would enable a more comprehensive intersectional analysis of autism referral pathways and help identify whether particular groups of females experience compounded barriers to timely diagnosis and support."
